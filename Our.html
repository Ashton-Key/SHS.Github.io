  <p class="bellp"> Our students use THIS Green, Black and Silver daily bell schedule. The system operates on a rotating schedule where students are assigned to either a Green (G), Black (B), or Silver (S) schedule each day. This schedule design is crafted to strengthen the connections between teachers and students. With fewer students to engage with each day, teachers have the opportunity to interact more frequently and dedicate longer periods to instructional time, thus fostering closer bonds.</p>
   <p class="Summit">Additional note about your schedule:</p>

  <p class="bellp">When reviewing the meeting days, please disregard the days labeled '1G, 1B, and 1S.' These are reserved for special bell schedules, where students will attend all seven periods. Detailed explanations will be provided before those special days. In the interim, your 1st period class will convene on the days that are not marked with a '1' next to them.</p>
