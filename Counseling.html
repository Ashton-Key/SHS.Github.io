  <p class="counselp">It's great to hear that your school offers support for students and parents through the counseling office. If you'd like assistance in rephrasing or expanding on this message, feel free to ask.</p>
  <p class="Specials">Schedule an Appointment:</p>
  <p class="counselp">School counselors are available to meet with students by appointment. If you have a quick question, email your counselor by using firstname.lastname@bend.k12.or.us. If you'd like to schedule a meeting with them, use the links below to find an appointment time in Calendly. When it's time for your appointment, show your confirmation email to your teacher in order to be excused from class. We will NOT send a note for you.</p>
